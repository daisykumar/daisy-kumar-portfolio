    Aftenposten Design Challenge: Going the GEN Z Way in 2020 and Beyond
</h1>

<p class="middle-para">
    <b>Project Context:</b>
    Aftenposten goal is to reach out to young people between 18 to 25 years and to carve out ways to connect itself as a news brand to them. 


</p>
<p class="middle-para">
    <b>Design Question 
    </b>
    How can Aftenposten present news and relevant context to young people (18 to 25 years) to increase use and engagement among them?

</p>

<p class="middle-para">
    I love to start things by empathising with my users. For this, I believe a well-conducted research on the users and their in-depth analysis is the key. If done well, you cover up at least 60% of your path while designing a product for your users. 
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
    During our workings we first sorted out this group of 18 to 25 years old as ‘Gen Z’. Studying their characteristics, behaviour, news consumption habits became spontaneous.  
</p>

<h2>Gen Z analysis and their Characteristics</h2>

<p class="middle-para">Also known as ‘iGeneration’- count Greta Thunberg and Zendaya among others- are an entirely new cohort of consumers. <B>Who are they?</B> A generation born between 1996 to 2010. Young and vibrant. Most-ethnically diverse. Grew up with technology and social media. Embrace entrepreneurialism and are eco-conscious. 
</p>

<h3>Key Points of Gen Z after User-Interview:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        They don’t feel connected with Aftenposten today
    </li>
    <li>
        Unwilling to pay for news or information as they think news should be free 

    </li>
    <li>

    <h2>
        Concept Description
        </h2>

        <p class="middle-para">
        The Gen Z of the revamped Aftenposten, <b>MODUS</b>, posts articles that he or she comes across through feature utrop. Engages with like-minded youth. Get his or her voice heard and awarded. While Aftenposten receives the news and approves those that it thinks best matches the interest of Gen Zers. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="middle-para">
        <b>From where this concept was formed?</b> As I said empathising is more important with the users to strike a chord. Here lies the key!
        
        The birth of citizen journalism is often attributed to South Korea where the first platform of amateur generated information, <b>OhMyNews</b>, was created. The principle was simple; anyone can take part in the process of creating information – as the notion of participatory  journalism (another term for citizen journalism) implies. 
    
        </p>
